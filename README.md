# ritual-love-letters
Love letters to and from Black femme thinkers and makers living a “creative life of refusal,” in the words of <a href="https://topicalcream.org/features/the-god-of-every-day/" target="_blank">Alexis Pauline Gumbs</a>. I share these letters with you as reminders and affirmations to help us sustain our creative practice(s) as a ritual of love to ourselves and our communities.
